Hello.
We are making tide chart application.
The result view should consist of chart with tide, 
text field for entering city name, and submit button.

Controller should first get coordinates by city name using CityService, 
then get tide data using TideService.

CityService uses GeoCoding API. 
TideService uses Stormglass API

Use dio to make requests.

Use fl_chart to create chart. 

Use GetBuilder to rebuild chart widget.
